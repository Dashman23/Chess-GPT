- Regular chess gameplay, necessary buttons and controls, and anything expected by the user will be on the left side of the screen
- Right side will be populated with a read-only remake of the chatgpt website, displaying what gets sent to the openai api and what gets received
<br>
- Working on Chatgpt implementation in backend (Heisn on GPT, David on Flask and js communication)
